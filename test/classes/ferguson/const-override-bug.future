error message: overriding parentheses-less value method with field

The problem here is that during function resolution, the call to the
field accessor function`name` in the constructor for myNumaDomain is
resolving to the `proc name` from class myLocale.

I think it's debateable whether or not we even want to support this
pattern. If we don't want to support it, we'd need a better error message
for this case.

If this behavior is meant to be supported, we need to fix something in
resolution so that the field name is preferred over the parent class
parentheses-less method name in the constructor for myNumaDomain. I
expect that to be the case with the new initializers.
