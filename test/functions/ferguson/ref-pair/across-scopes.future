semantic: should ref-pairs be allowed across scopes?

After PR #5561, the behavior of this program changed, because const ref
vs value return is now included in ref-pair calculations in
resolveNormalCall. However, the issue started with the first versions of
ref-pair support in the compiler.

The question is - if normal resolution rules would select the ref/const
ref/value version in preference to the other version, should that always
be used? Should ref-pair behavior only be triggered if there would
otherwise be an ambiguity? It's not currently the case as this test
demonstrates.

One reason the answer to this question isn't entirely obvious is that
generic functions with a matching `where` clause are normally selected in
favor of generic functions without a `where` clause. That pattern comes
up in the array accessor methods, where the `ref` return version does not
have a `where` clause but the value or const ref return versions do.
